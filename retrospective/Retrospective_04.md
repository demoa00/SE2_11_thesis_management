The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done : 12 / 
- Total points committed vs done : 47 / 
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) : 98h /

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation) : ; (e,a): ()
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1 : 

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 
  - Total hours spent : 
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : 
  - Coverage (if available) : 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 3h
  - Total hours spent : 
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated : 6h
  - Total hours spent : 
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated : 3h
  - Total hours spent : 
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube : 
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues
  - Hours spent on remediation
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability")
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
