TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 11)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 4/0
- Total points committed vs. done: 20/0
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) 96/87h45m

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_  | 5       | /      | 30         | 31.75        | 
| _#1_  | 10      | 8      | 19         | 16           |
| _#2_  | 10      | 8      | 19         | 16           |
| _#3_  | 6       | 2      | 16         | 13.5         |
| _#4_  | 4       | 2      | 12         | 10.5         |

   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  Total hours: 87.75 ; # of tasks: 35 --> Hours per task average: 2.5 (2h 30m) 
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 = ( 96 / 87.75 ) - 1 = 0.09402

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 12
  - Total hours spent: 7.5
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 37 
  - Coverage (if available): 70%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated 0
  - Total hours spent 0
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 4.5 
  - Total hours spent: 1.5
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? 
  > Some unclear specifications and underestimation of the complexity of the tasks for a specific story

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? 
  > We learned how to use the tools and that we have to build stuff focused on the demo and not for the future implementations.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  > This is the first retrospective for this project. Thinking about the retrospective of the demo project, we managed better organize ourselves the work and the time.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  > We didn't achieve the goal of having a working prototype for the demo. We underestimated the complexity of the tasks and we didn't have enough time to complete them.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  > We want to better focus on the stories and each task and to finish them properly.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  > We built a solid structure ready for future implementations and release.
